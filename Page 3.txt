       <p> I have always been really passionate about innovations and technology. Right since the 4th grade I was really interested into Coding and Artificial intelligence which later led me to take computer science in the 8th grade as well as in college and as a result I was the one the best coders in my college. During the Course of my 11th and 12th I have prepared multiple websites and also taken part in and intercollege competition for the same. Being interested in Technology and Research I decided to get my Btech degree in Computer Science and Specialize in Cyber Security.Iâ€™ve also always had a spark to keep learning more and more in this field as technological advancements today are changing human lives and taking it to new bounds.</p>
